# Brake Pads
[Brake pads](https://nrsbrakes.com/) are a component of disc brakes used in automotive and other applications. Brake pads are composed of steel backing plates with friction material bound to the surface that faces the disc brake rotors.
Brake pads are flat components made of ceramic, organic or semi-metallic materials attached to a metal backing. Every time you apply the brakes, these pads hydraulically squeeze your brake discs, using pressure and friction to slow the movement of your car.
